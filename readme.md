## Getting Start
Prerequisites
* Rust
* Docker
* A server running [Molmo-7B-D-0924](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Molmo-7B-D-0924). See the Docker + vllm example [script](./scripts/start-molmo.sh)

## Roadmap
* Improve Documentation
* Remove all my person stuff from the repo
* Improve debugging and logging
  * Remove all the println statements
  * Provide the inputs/outputs for each LLM interactive in an easily debuggable format
* Add an actual test suite to the end-to-end project
  * Includes running these tests in CI
* Create bindings for other languages
  * Ruby
  * Python
  * JavaScript/Typescript
  * Others?
* Create a UI to help build out the selectors. It can be time consuming to come up with an accurate selector. 


### Why the name George?

This is George. Most of the time he does what he's supposed to, but sometimes he doesn't do the
right thing at all. He's a living embodiment of current AI expectations.
