created a docker image that will run the george client plus firefox. I was able to take a screenshot of FF running
inside the image

```
docker build -t george-client-image .
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 george-client-image
```


Testing out the click feature
* 75.0, 83.5 point coordinates of the skip this step button
* 1024x768 =  768,641.28

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/click \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"x": 768, "y": 641}'
```
